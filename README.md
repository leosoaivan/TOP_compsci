# Ruby and Computer Science

A collection of exercises from TOP (The Odin Project), focusing on computer science fundamentals, such as recursion, data structures, and algorithms. See  http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming#section-a-bit-of-computer-science for more information.

<h3>Linked Lists</h3>
The implementation of a linked list, a basic data structure (absent in Ruby). Created with a <code>Node</code> class and a <code>LinkedList</code> class. Found at <a href="https://github.com/leosoaivan/TOP_compsci/blob/master/linked_list.rb">linked_list.rb</a>.


<h3>Binary Search Tree</h3>
The implementation of a binary search tree (BST), another basic data structure (absent in Ruby). Created with a <code>Node</code> class and a <code>BST</code> class. This implementation includes recursive methods to create BSTs from both sorted and unsorted arrays. Also included are a few traversal methods. Found at <a href="https://github.com/leosoaivan/TOP_compsci/blob/master/binary_tree.rb">binary_tree.rb</a>.

<h3>Knight's Travails</h3>
This project focused on building a custom data structure that would allow the user to create the shortest path on a standard chessboard following a knight's movements from a starting point to a destination point set by a user.

To see the script in action, fork the repo and run `ruby lib/travails.rb'.
